# 100-prisoners-problem
The 100 prisoners problem is a mathematical problem in probability theory and combinatorics. In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive. The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and cannot communicate with other prisoners.

100.cpp file will find the best probabiity for the prisoners to survive.
generate.cpp file generates the date of the boxes of 100 prisoners as boxes with the no. on their particular index as box number.
